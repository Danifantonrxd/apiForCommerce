myCommerce API REST is an application programming interface (API) designed specifically for an online commerce platform. It offers a comprehensive set of features and functionalities to facilitate seamless communication and data management between client applications and the commerce platform. Let's break down the key components of myCommerce API REST:

1. CRUD Functions:
myCommerce API REST provides full support for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It enables clients to interact with the underlying commerce platform by creating new resources, retrieving existing ones, updating resource data, and deleting resources as needed. This allows for efficient management of products, orders, customer information, and other essential commerce-related entities.

2. Authorization with JWT:
myCommerce API REST incorporates industry-standard authentication and authorization mechanisms using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It ensures secure access to the API endpoints and protects sensitive data by verifying the identity and authorization of clients. With JWT-based authentication, clients can obtain a token upon successful login, and subsequent requests to the API endpoints are validated using the provided token, thus ensuring secure access to protected resources.

3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests:
myCommerce API REST is equipped with a comprehensive suite of end-to-end (E2E) tests. These tests cover the entire API workflow, simulating real-world scenarios to validate the functionality, reliability, and performance of the API. E2E tests ensure that all the components and integrations within the API ecosystem, including the CRUD functions and authorization mechanisms, are working seamlessly and as expected. This helps identify and rectify any issues or bugs, ensuring a robust and error-free API implementation.

4. Implements Clean Architecture: 
myCommerce API REST follow the principles of clean architecture, which is a design pattern that separates the business logic from the presentation, data access and external dependencies of your web service. This way, you can achieve a modular, testable and maintainable code base that is easy to understand and extend. 

5 Database design with Sequelize-Migrations ORM: 
myCommerce API REST use a relational database design, which is a method of organizing data into tables and relationships that optimize the storage and retrieval of information. You can use tables for products, orders, customers and categories with columns that store their attributes such as name, price, quantity, status, etc. Designed with relationships between these tables using foreign keys and constraints that enforce data integrity and consistency.

Overall, myCommerce API REST provides a powerful and reliable foundation for building and integrating an online commerce platform. With its CRUD operations, JWT-based authorization, and thorough E2E testing, it offers a secure and efficient solution for managing e-commerce-related data and ensuring a seamless experience for both clients and end-users.
